# Particle Flow Visualization

![Particle Flow Visualization](/curl.png)

This project demonstrates an interactive particle flow visualization using JavaScript and HTML Canvas. It utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, mathematical calculations, and flow field algorithms to generate mesmerizing visual effects.

## Overview

This visualization generates a field of particles that move based on a calculated flow field, creating dynamic patterns and shapes. It includes features such as:

- **Particle Dynamics**: Each particle's movement is determined by its position in the flow field, influencing its speed and direction.
- **Zoom and Shape Selection**: Users can adjust the zoom level and select different shapes to observe varied flow patterns.
- **Responsive Canvas**: The canvas adjusts its size according to the window dimensions for an immersive experience.

## Concepts and Utilization

- **JavaScript**: Utilized for scripting and interactivity.
- **HTML Canvas**: Rendering engine for generating visual effects.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Implemented through classes to manage particles, effects, and user interactions.
- **Mathematical Concepts**: Trigonometry (sine, cosine) used for particle movement based on angles within the flow field.

## Performance and GPU Utilization

This visualization heavily relies on GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) for smooth rendering and real-time interaction. The performance might vary based on the user's device capabilities and browser support for hardware acceleration.

For optimal performance:

- Use a modern web browser that supports hardware acceleration.
- Ensure your device has a capable GPU for rendering complex visuals efficiently.
- Adjusting the number of particles or complexity of the flow field may impact performance on lower-end devices.

## Code Structure

### Classes

- **Particle**: Represents individual particles with properties such as position, speed, and history of movement.
- **Effect**: Manages the flow field, particle initialization, canvas rendering, and user interaction functionalities.

### Functions

- **animate()**: Handles the continuous rendering of the visualization by clearing the canvas and updating the effect.
- **init()**: Initializes the flow field, calculates angles, and creates particles based on user settings.

### Event Listeners

- **resize**: Ensures responsiveness by updating canvas and particles upon window resizing.
- **input & change**: Controls zoom levels and shape selection, triggering updates in the visualization.

## Getting Started

To run this visualization locally:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Interact with the controls:
   - Adjust the zoom level using the range input.
   - Choose different shapes from the dropdown menu.
4. Explore the mesmerizing flow patterns generated by the particles!
